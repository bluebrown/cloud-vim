# Cloud VIM

IDE style VIM configuration in a docker container with built-in docker engine and ssh server.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

If you want to use this image locally you need to have docker installed. Otherwise you need a cloud provider or a server with docker engine to invoke your service at all times remotely.

### No Prequisites Solution 

You can simply use something like play-with-docker to pull the image and spin up a quick throw-away IDE without any prequisites other than a web browser with internet connection.
